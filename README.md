Ludum Dare 35 submission

My submission for the Ludum Dare 35. The theme was "Shapeshifting". I made a brawler where the players can change of form, each having different capacities.

Some bugs, obviously. Missing shapes 3 & 4 too, and don't go out of the ring. You'll fall. Seriously.

There could be 4 players max.

The keyboard config is the following :

A - left
D - right
W - up
S - down
K - Fire1
L - Fire2
The joypad config may vary, but on an Xbox pad, I use A for Fire1 and B for Fire2
You can pause / unpause the game with the Escape key

No walls, so out of the camera, you'll fall. Didn't had the time to fix it.
